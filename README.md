## Idea

Today, the 30th of May 2015, I was at a [XPUG Milan Coderetreat](http://coderetreat.org/events/xpug-milan-coderetreat) that was very interesting.

We had fun coding implementations of the [Game of Life][1].

As a mathematician, I found it a very interesting problem and I could not resist to generalize it and try to solve it in any of its variations.

Let's start with some abstractions.

The definition of a function *getNeighboursOf* which returns the set of cells adjacent to a given cell, defines a universe of a *Game of Life*.

Infact, since

    getNeighboursOf(cell1) = getNeightboursOf(cell2) â‡’ cell1 = cell2

it can be said that the set of neighbours of a cell is dual to the cell itself, hence the definition of the *getNeighboursOf* function it is equivalent to the definition of the space of a *Game of Life* universe. Note that it defines the concept of **nearness**.

In other words,

> if you define a *getNeighbours* function you also shape the space of a *Game of Life* universe

The universe also has *rules*, which are not abstracted out in this study, but are generalized in their thresholds

1. Any live cell with fewer than `a` live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with `a` or `b` live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than `b` live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
4. Any dead cell with exactly `c` live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

where in the classic *Game of Life* rules,

    a = 2
    b = 3
    c = 3

On the other hand, let be given the definition of an *isAlive* function, which returns true if the given cell is alive, false otherwise.
It can be easily extended to an *areAlive* function which returns a list of booleans, given a list of cells and, following a similar identification we used for the *getNeighboursOf* function, an *isAlive* function describes the state of a *Game of Life* universe at a given moment.

The considerations above let implement an **abstract** *Game of Life* in a functional way, in any of its variations in the finite dimensional case, for example:

* finite grid
* infinite grid
* 2-dimensional, 3-dimensional, n-dimensional
* square, triangular, hexagonal tiles
* cylinder, torus, moebius strip, boy surface

Take a look to [gameOfLife.js](https://github.com/fibo/games-of-life/blob/master/src/gameOfLife.js) for the implementation details.

## Example

A simple example is the [infinite grid with two dimensional coordinates](https://github.com/fibo/games-of-life/blob/master/test/infiniteGridWithTwoDimensionalCoordinates.js).

Define a *getNeighboursOf* which returns the neighbours of a given cell.

```
function getNeighboursOf (cell) {
  var x = cell[0],
      y = cell[1]

  var neighbours = []

  for (var j = y - 1; j <= y + 1; j++) {
    for (var i = x - 1; i <= x + 1; i++) {
      if ((i === x) && (j === y))
        continue

      neighbours.push([i, j])
    }
  }

  return neighbours
}
```

Create the *evolve* function for this *Game of Life* universe

```
var gameOfLife = require('gameOfLife')

var evolve = gameOfLife(getNeighboursOf)
```

The empty grid is a function that always returns false, so

```
function emptyGrid () {
  return false
}

evolve(emptyGrid) // will always return false
```

Ok, a more interesting example is the blinker

![Blinker](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Game_of_life_blinker.gif)

```
function horyzontalBlinker (cell) {
  var x = cell[0],
      y = cell[1]

  if (y !== 0)
    return false

  if ((x >= -1) && (x <= 1))
    return true

  return false
}

function verticalBlinker (cell) {
  var x = cell[0],
      y = cell[1]

  if (x !== 0)
    return false

  if ((y >= -1) && (y <= 1))
    return true

  return false
}
```

You can check that the verticalBlinker evolves in the horyzontalBlinker and viceversa

```
for (var i = -1; i < 1; i++)
  for (var j = -1; j < 1; j++)
    console.log(evolve(verticalBlinker)(i, j) ===  horyzontalBlinker(i, j)) // true
```
