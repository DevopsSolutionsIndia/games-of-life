> A Mathematical solution to any Game of Life variation

Today, the 30th of May 2015, I was at a [XPUG Milan Coderetreat](http://coderetreat.org/events/xpug-milan-coderetreat) that was very interesting.

We had fun coding implementations of the [Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). As a mathematician, I found it a very interesting problem and I could not resist to generalize it and try to solve it in any of its variations.

Let's start with some abstractions.
